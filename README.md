# photography_portfolio

A basic website for a featured photographer, me!

Note: None of the photos displayed on the site were taken by me, but are public domain through creative commons. The photo on the about page is an actual picture of me.

Includes:
  A responsive Bootstrap menu (navbar) that appears on all pages.
  A footer that appears on all pages.
  A home page that introduces the viewer to me, the photographer.
  A portfolio page that showcases 9 images using the Bootstrap grid to arrange the photos.
  A reviews page that lists reviews from customers.
  An about page with my photo and a brief introduction.
